To run creature generation run `python3 algorithm.py`

In `algorithm.py`, there are parameters that you can modify to run the simulation differently, such as



`numChildren` - Modifies the number of children per generation

`numGenerations` - Modifies the number of generations run throughout the simulation



Starting values such as:

`legSize` - The median leg size of the first generation of creatures

`speed` - The median speed of the legs of the first generation of creatures

`gear` - The median torque of the legs of the first generation of creatures

`numLeftLegs` - The number of left legs for the first generation of creatures

`numRightLegs` - The number of left legs for the first generation of creatures
